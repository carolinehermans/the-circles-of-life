Processing sketch for marking up hundreds of images of pregnant women with fitting circles. Follow my personal results at @the.circles.of.life on Instagram.

## Instructions

To mark up your own pregnant lady images, create a directory called "data" inside the pregnantladies folder. Keep your images of pregnant ladies inside this "data" folder. 

Then, name your images chronologically from 1 to however many images you have. Your folder should contain images titled "1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg..." etc.

Edit the variable startImgNum and endImgNum to correspond to the first image and the last image number that you'd like to mark up.

Run the sketch. Click to place three dots on each woman's belly, and then press the space bar to go to the next lady. If you've drawn a circle, this will save an image of the canvas to your current directory. Continue creating circles and hitting space until you are done.
